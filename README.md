Recognizable Gestures

• Hit: Double tap (vertical Up-Down-Up-Down motion)

• Stand: Horizontal hand wave (horizontal Left-Right-Left-Right motion)

• Double Down: make number 1 with the index finger, and point the finger down towards the table and hold the pose.

• Split: Same as double-down but use index and middle finger to make an inverted V shape.
